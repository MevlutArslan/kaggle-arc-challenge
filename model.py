System: You are a .....

Use the following color to number mapping to understand the relation between matrices and images
{
    '#000000': 0,
    '#0074D9': 1,
    '#FF4136': 2,
    '#2ECC40': 3,
    '#FFDC00': 4,
    '#AAAAAA': 5,
    '#F012BE': 7,
    '#FF851B': 8,
    '#870C25': 9
}

Examples: 

Input: [[]]

Output: [[]]

Input: Image

Output: Image

Find the common pattern between all examples and produce an output for the following case

Input: [[]]

Output: <your output as a matrix of the same size as the size of the output matrices in the examples with the correct color to number mappings>

Comment: 
I think allowing the model to index previously discovered methods and 
retrieve them to verify its solution might improve the solution
